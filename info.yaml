# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Optimised Euclidean Algorithm"      # Project title
  description:  "Finding gcd of 2 4-bit number"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "This circuit finds the gcd (greatest common divisor) of 2 4-bit numbers which are entered by dip switch and it uses the Euclidean algorithm. Result displays by seven segment display. The algorithm has been optimized by designing the control unit and datapath."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  ""      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
